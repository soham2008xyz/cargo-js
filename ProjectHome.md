Cargo.js is intended to be an easily scalable package collection of different kind of functions. Like in java, you only use what you need. The idea here is the same. You only need to include parts of the whole, only what you need.

Some packages are built on top of others, but with the import system it is easy to maintain dependency.

Cargo's original purpose is to provide a diverse set of functions structured into modules for just about any task.

The module structure enables to extend the library, change or upgrade functions without braking the code that uses it. All you need to do is include a package on a page and use it. A general rule behind the library is to never change syntax. If you start using Cargo now, you can be sure that property names and argument signatures will be the same next year. This is to eliminate the need of updating your code on version changes. It's a guarantee.

Cargo is not intended to solve browser inconsistency, and thus not encouraged to use in corporate environment, but rather aims to bring the most of today's new code practices.

The modular system allows easy scalability of the library, and makes it available to extend it further.

The initial intention behind writing Cargo was to experiment and learn to code. Using stuff other's write may be nice and dandy but this way no one can evolve. Cargo is a practice run for developing even greater things, and on the way of writing it and learn coding, the library may grow big and good enough to be proud of in the future. For now, it's the growing love child of me and my love for programming.
